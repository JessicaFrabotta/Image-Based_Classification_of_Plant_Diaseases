Before running the command to create the docker image, enter the directory named "1758527_app" from your terminal. 
You should be on the same level of the files app.py, requirements.txt etc.

Now run the command:
docker build -t 1758527_app .

At this point create a container with the command:

docker run -dp 8501:8501 1758527_app

You can find the app in the container section of Docker Desktop.
